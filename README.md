# 🧑🏻‍💼**The Real Work-Life Story:** 
### *work_life_Analysis - A primary data perspective*

## Project Overview:
This project is based on primary data analysis collected through a Google Form. The survey was distributed to working professionals across various industry domains to gain insights into their work-life balance. The form was thoughtfully structured into three key sections:
1.	Basic Information – capturing demographic and background details
2.	Job Satisfaction & Alignment – understanding how well individuals feel aligned with their roles and overall job satisfaction
3.	Educational Aspirations – exploring their interest in further studies and the barriers they may face.
   
The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns in how career paths, satisfaction levels, and personal growth opportunities intersect in the modern workplace. Feel free to participate in the survey through the link below—it would be great to have your perspective.

“The Power BI dashboard is connected to a MySQL database, enabling automatic updates as new survey responses are submitted. This ensures that insights remain fresh, relevant, and reflective of the latest input.
You can explore the full dashboard overview toward the end of this README.”

## 📊 [Data Source] (https://forms.gle/U1EwJVpsg6gqrv5w7)
This project is based entirely on primary data collected through a Google Form survey. The questionnaire was designed to explore various dimensions of work-life dynamics among working professionals.To prepare the data for analysis, all survey questions were transformed into meaningful column names, structuring the dataset for better interpretation and visualization. Below is the list of cleaned and formatted columns:

## 🛠️ Tools Used
For this project, I used the following tools to handle data preparation, analysis, and visualization:
- **<ins>Microsoft Excel:</ins>** Imported the raw data from the Google Form and performed data cleaning and structuring.
- **<ins>MySQL:</ins>** Transferred the cleaned dataset into MySQL to write and execute queries efficiently. It was also used to manage and store the structured data in a relational database.
- **<ins>Power BI:</ins>** Utilized to design an interactive dashboard that visually communicates the insights through various charts, slicers, and storytelling elements.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation: How I Structured the Data
-	Imported raw survey data from the Google Form into Excel.
-	Standardized column names for clarity and consistency (e.g., Job_Satisfaction_Rating, Work_Culture, Annual_Salary_Range).
-	Converted categorical responses into analysis-friendly formats:
-	Assigned numeric codes to qualitative options (e.g., salary ranges).
-	Handled blanks and inconsistent entries using logical imputation and conditional formatting.
-	Loaded the cleaned dataset into MySQL for efficient querying and storage.

## 📈 Data Analysis – KPIs
Key metrics identified to evaluate the work-life landscape:
-	Average Job Satisfaction Rating
-	Percentage of Respondents Feeling Safe/Respected at Work
- Distribution of Annual Salary Ranges
-	Alignment of Jobs with Educational Background
-	Industry-wise Job Satisfaction Trends
-	Mental Health Impact Score Across Age Groups
-	Proportion Interested in Further Education vs Barriers Faced
These KPIs helped surface high-level insights for deeper exploration.

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Used SQL queries to segment data by age group, gender, industry, and experience.
-	Plotted clustered bar charts and stacked columns in Power BI to visualize:
-	Job satisfaction variation across industries
-	Correlation between experience and salary expectations
-	Differences in mental health impact based on work culture
-	Identify undervalued candidates 
-	Incorporated slicers to allow interactive filtering by demographic categories.


---

## 📊 Results and Findings
-	Despite holding postgraduate qualifications, many respondents are employed in roles with salaries that do not reflect their education level. This suggests potential mismatches in the job market, such as limited role availability or inefficiencies in the recruitment and placement process.
-	Job satisfaction was notably higher among those working in domains aligned with their studies.
-	Respondents in industries with supportive work culture reported fewer negative mental health impacts.
-	A significant percentage felt unsafe or unrespected, particularly in high-stress domains.
-	Salary satisfaction did not always align with actual income brackets, revealing perception gaps.
-	Many showed interest in further education, but cited financial and time constraints as key barriers.
-	In some industries, professionals with 4–6 years of experience earn below current market averages—highlighting a possible undervaluation of mid-level talent.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
Based on the insights, the following suggestions can drive improvement:
-	Foster inclusive work cultures to reduce psychological stress.
-	Offer upskilling programs tied to employee interests and career growth.
-	Promote education-aligned career pathways, especially for early professionals.
-	Conduct regular feedback assessments to stay responsive to employee needs.
-	Implementing structured and skill-based recruitment practices can help ensure fair compensation and prevent the undervaluation of highly qualified candidates. This is especially relevant where postgraduates and graduates are offered similar salary packages despite differences in academic credentials and expertise.

## 🚧 Limitations (Challenges Faced)
-	Sample Size: The dataset reflects responses from a specific population and may not fully represent broader demographics.
-	Technical Roadblocks: Initial issues connecting Excel with MySQL required troubleshooting with connectors and schema mapping.
-	Category Encoding: Converting qualitative data into analysable numeric categories took time to ensure accuracy and consistency.
-	Subjectivity in Responses: As with most survey-based studies, responses reflect individual perception and may include personal bias. However, patterns were cross-validated to ensure meaningful insights.
